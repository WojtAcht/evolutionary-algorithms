    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory we will use tools and test functions provided by a library pymoo. It is a well recognized optimization library created specifically for multi-objective problems. However, it does contain a wide range of single-objective metaheuristics more than sufficient for this laboratory.\n",

    "For documentation refer to https://pymoo.org/\n",

    "### CMA-ES introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A robust guide to CMA-ES is available at https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1604.00772\n",
    "\n",
    "Pymoo does not provide its own implementation of CMA-ES instead it calls the pycma library which is mantained by the author of the algorithm Nikolaus Hansen https://pypi.org/project/cma/. Other notable implementation of this algorithm is available at https://pypi.org/project/cmaes/ library. You can look up the visualizations provided in its documentation to get a better grasp on how different variants of the algorithm work."
